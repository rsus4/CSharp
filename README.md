This app is a platform for promoting local musicians. It helps them collaborate with other musicians and get to know them and their music. It also gives them a platform to monetize their work as they can sell their tracks to interested customers. There is also an option for the musicians to sell their musical equipment to interested customers. With the help of this application, different event managers and recording studios can connect with musicians who have registered on the platform, who might want to approach them for performing in some event or recording a track. The customers might also want to buy the musiciansâ€™ track or their equipment. Anybody associated with the application can either be a regular member of a premium member of the application based on whether they have bought membership or not.
